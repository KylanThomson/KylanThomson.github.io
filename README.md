## Welcome

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for designing, developing, and implementing applications and solutions using a range of technologies and programming languages. Seeking to leverage broad development experience and hands-on technical expertise in a challenging role as a Full-stack Web Developer. This is the repository I made for hosting my portfolio site.

Please feel free to use this repository for your own portfolio site. Bear in mind the following:

- If you want to host your website via Github you must make a repository **{your_Github_username}.github.io.md**
- Include index.html in your repository
- If you like the styling and only want to change the contents of my site to reflect your accomplishments then only modify the index.html file
